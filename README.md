LetsHaveKiddos | DOTS-Shack
===========================
A revist of a theme I made a while back inspired from this awesome pixel art background. 

I provided a couple different variations of the background.

I wish I could give the source / give credit to original author but I actually had a hard time finding a name. 
I found it on pinterest. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

## Tools used
i3-gaps, i3lock-fancy or i3lock-color & betterlockscreen, rofi, dunst, kitty, sublime, neovim, polybar, thunar.

I provide GTK and QT options.

No extra changes for GTK needed, for QT I recommend plastique. If youre on arch [aur/qt5-styleplugins-git]


## Boot 

I provided a grub theme (mostly just colors but hey its consistent with the theme)

If you're not comfortable changing this I wouldn't even bother. It's a bit of a hassle.

## Notes

I recommend going through and changing the "monitor: DP-2" or any variation of this and using "xrandr" to change to your monitor(s).   
I'm super OCD and like my rofi/dunst/polybar to spawn only on one of my monitors. I'm not sure everything you should look at but rofi/polybar/i3 are for sure you should look in the configs.
